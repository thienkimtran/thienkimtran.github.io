I recently learned Python in SDS348. Python is a programming language similar to R, but has various differences including better software for neural nets, better deployment of scale/pipelines, and quicker speed. These are some examples of python code!

```{python}
list1=[1,2,3,4] 
list2=['a','b','c','d']
list1[0]
list2[-1]
list2[::2]
```   

```{python}
for i in range(5):
 print(i)
for letter in "abcdefg":
 print(letter)
mylist = [1, 2, 3, 4]
for i in mylist:
 print(i)
for letter in "abcdefg":
 print(letter)
i= 1
while i < 11:
 print(2**i)
 i+=1
def add_one(x):
 return x+1
add_one(2)
```

```{python}
import numpy as np
x=np.array([1,2,3])
x
print(x/2+1)
x.shape
mat1=np.array([[1,2],[3,4]])
mat1
```


The Reticulate package lets R and Python interact with each other by sharing code across R and Python as shown below!
```{R}
#R code chunk
library(reticulate)
really<-"very"
```

```{python}
#Python code chunk
really="happy"
print(r.really,really)
```  
```{R}
#R code chunk
cat(c(really,py$really))
```
